## Initial stages
I have a lot of luck using resources as a template. Joel Dore and Shannon Quinn in our 5pm study group offered up their projects and I relied heavily on their hws to help guide me. I don't plan on making this a common practice but it's hard to deny the fact that seeing how the functions fit together in a working example helps me understand better than anything I learned in the lessons. That being said, I worked very hard to translate the codes into something that worked for me, in my own language. I hope that shows. 

## Struggles
I'm still confused about setting parameters and arguments in functions. I'd say it's probably my biggest source of frustration at this point. That being said, it's pretty heartening to see that I don't need to google simple things anymore and can now spontaneously create formulas that were nearly impossible a week ago. Another struggle is that I don't really know what a UV Index is but Austin has a really high one.
