## Initial stages
I have a lot of luck using resources as a template. Joel Dore and Shannon Quinn in our 5pm study group offered up their projects and I relied heavily on their hws to help guide me. I don't plan on making this a common practice but it's hard to deny the fact that seeing how the functions fit together in a working example helps me understand better than anything I learned in the lessons. That being said, I worked very hard to translate the codes into something that worked for me, in my own language. I hope that shows. 

## Struggles
I'm still confused about scoping. Setting variables, parameters and arguments in functions and then where to call them. I'd say it's probably my biggest source of frustration at this point. That being said, it's pretty heartening to see that I don't need to google simple things anymore and can now spontaneously create formulas that were nearly impossible a week ago. Like coloring the UV index is just a copy paste job from one of my other homeworks. 

## Local Storage
Still struggling with what it is and why it's here and what I'm supposed to do with it
